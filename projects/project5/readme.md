# Titanic Dataset Project

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook (TreeonTitanic.ipynb) explores the Titanic dataset, implementing analysis and visualization of passenger information. The project aims to gain insights into factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

Dataset: The dataset ([titanic.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)) is provided by [Data Science Dojo](https://datasciencedojo.com/) and includes the following features:

- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- Name: Passenger's name.
- Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female).
- Age: Age of the passenger.
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
