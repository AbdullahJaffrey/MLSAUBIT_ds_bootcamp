## Linear Regression Project

**Overview:**
This Jupyter Notebook (`LinearRegression.ipynb`) implements a linear regression model for predicting company revenue based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdullahJaffrey/Datasets/master/stocks.csv`) that includes information about different companies, such as their industry, revenue, revenue growth, number of employees, and headquarters.

**Dataset:**
The dataset (`stocks.csv`) includes the following features:

- **Rank:** Company rank.
- **Name:** Company name.
- **Industry:** Industry in which the company operates.
- **Revenue (USD millions):** Company revenue in USD millions.
- **Revenue growth:** Percentage growth in revenue.
- **Employees:** Number of employees in the company.
- **Headquarters:** Location of the company's headquarters.

**Files:**
- `LinearRegression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the linear regression model.
- `stocks.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model.

**GitHub Folder:**
The project files are available in the following GitHub folder: [MLSAUBIT_ds_bootcamp - Project 4](https://github.com/AbdullahJaffrey/MLSAUBIT_ds_bootcamp/tree/main/projects/project4/LinearRegression)

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AbdullahJaffrey/MLSAUBIT_ds_bootcamp.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd MLSAUBIT_ds_bootcamp/projects/project4/LinearRegression`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `LinearRegression.ipynb` to explore the linear regression model and predictions.
4. Feel free to modify the code or dataset as needed. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please open an issue.

Happy exploring!
