# Project 7: Canada Per Capita Income Prediction

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook (`LR_canada.ipynb`) explores the Canada Per Capita Income dataset, implementing linear regression analysis to predict per capita income. The project aims to analyze the relationship between the year and per capita income and build a predictive model using linear regression.

**Dataset**: The `canada_per_capita_income.csv` dataset contains two columns:
- Year: The year
- Per Capita Income (US$): The per capita income for that year in US dollars

**LR_canada.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualization of the Canada Per Capita Income dataset using linear regression.
